# Installation

```python
pip install aiolinkding
```

# Python Versions

`aiolinkding` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* Python 3.10

# Usage

## Creating a Client

It's easy to create an API client for a linkding instance. All you need are two
parameters:

1. A URL to a linkding instance
2. A linkding API token

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aiolinkding import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    client = Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "token_abcde12345")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Working with Bookmarks

The `Client` object provides easy access to several bookmark-related API operations:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aiolinkding import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    client = Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "token_abcde12345")

    # Get all bookmarks:
    bookmarks = await client.bookmarks.async_all()
    # >>> { "count": 5, "next": null, "previous": null, "results": [...] }


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to linkding with each coroutine. If you
are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second of
runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        # Create a Notion API client:
        client = Client("http://127.0.0.1:8000", "token_abcde12345", session=session)

        # Get to work...


asyncio.run(main())
```
